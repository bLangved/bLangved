## About me

I am 31 years old, and live in Skien, Telemark in Norway. I started my programming some years back with Python, SQL and .NET while doing an engineering degree (that eventually did not work out), but I caught an interest in programming, and wanted to do more creative work, and that eventually led me down the path of Frontend-development. 

### Things I'm working with ðŸŒ±
* Trying to write even more semantic HTML, and focusing on accessibility-features
* Learning the web-framework Astro 
* Getting better at React

### Things I want to check out in the near future
* Tailwind CSS

### Besides writing code
* :video_game: Gaming
* :shallow_pan_of_food: Cooking
* :running: Exercise
* :guitar::musical_keyboard: Playing guitar & piano
* :house::bulb: Smarthome-automation and gadgets
