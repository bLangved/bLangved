Hi! :wave:
I'm BjÃ¸rnar Heian Langved 

<br>

I'm currently studying to become a {front-end developer}! :man_student::computer:
- Halfway through my studies at Noroff - School of technology and digital media

<br>

Programing languages I know fairly well: <br>
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Javascript

<br>

I also have decent knowledge on CMS-platforms like:
- Wordpress

<br>

I also have a little knowledge, and been working a little with languages like: 
Python & SQL (both MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server from when I learned a little .NET).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on completing the web-development course on Mimo.org

<br>

I'm a big tech-nerd, and really interested in smarthome-automation :house::bulb:, but mainly been using Apple HomeKit, and some few plugins with HomeBridge which I have installed on a Raspberry Pi. <br>
I'm planning on checking out, and working more with things like: <br>

- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- HomeBridge
- Home Assistance

<br>

Beside programming (which is also a hobby!), I enjoy things like: <br>
:video_game: Gaming <br>
:shallow_pan_of_food: Cooking <br>
:running: Exercise <br>
:guitar::musical_keyboard: Playing guitar & piano <br>
